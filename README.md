# Capstone-Project
*Project 7: Capstone, Stage 1 - Design | Android Nanodegree*


Project Requirements
Your Project must:
- Import and build on the latest version of Android Studio (Eclipse users take note)
- Be entirely self-contained on an Android device (No external devices/bluetooth peripherals).
- Include a problem description of the problem your app solves.
- Include mocks for all user-facing screens.
- Include a signed .apk of your app. Instructions on creating a signed .apk can be found here.
- Include at least one alternate mock for tablet / large screens.
- Implement all mockups, including your tablet layout.
- Have at least two distinct screens (ex. a list view and a detail view).
- Work properly with the app lifecycle (i.e. you must preserve any dynamic instance state on orientation change).
- Use permissions responsibly.
- Use Intents to move between activities inside your app or to an outside app.
- Create and use your own ContentProvider
- Use Loaders to move your data to your views.
- If the application pulls or sends data to/from a web service or API, it handles this network activity properly (i.e on the correct thread, does not abuse network resources)
- Include only safe-for-work content in your app
